# CSharp_Console_ClassesAndObjects
Creating classes and objects in C#

It is a simple console application which has different geometric shape classes ( Rectangle and Triangle )

You can understand how the objects can be created from the classes

Rectangle Class
You need to provide width and height information to create a new rectangle object in order to calculate its area and perimeter

Triangle Class ( It is actually a righttriangle (which has a 90 C angle) )
You need to provide width and height information to create a new triangle object in order to calculate its area and perimeter

Hope this will help you to understand same basic of class & object fundamantels.

Motivate yourself for 10 minutes coding everyday!
